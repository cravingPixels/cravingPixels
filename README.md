## üëã Hi there, I'm Martino Ferrara (He/Him)

### üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª About me
I'm a Backend Software Engineer at [Cleafy](https://www.cleafy.com/), where I've been fortifying its real-time anti-fraud system for 1.5 years. Prior to this, I navigated the cybersecurity realm for 3 years, first as a SOC Cyber Security Analyst and then as a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst both at [Communication Valley - Reply](https://www.reply.com/it/cybersecurity/cyber-security-operation-center).

I'm deeply passionate about continuous learning. Currently, I'm broadening my tech horizon at [Politecnico di Milano University](https://www.polimi.it), delving into CS & Engineering courses, and at [CSPrimer](https://csprimer.com), to gain
working knowledge of many fundamental topics with the founder of [Bradfield School of Computer Science](https://bradfieldcs.com). Also, I'm tackling the [#48in24 Exercism challenge](https://exercism.org/challenges/48in24), pushing my limits one code at a time!
